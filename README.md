# Personal Website
This repository contains the code for a sample personal website. This is a side project to explore React front end UI dev.

# Installation
I used a third party package for ease of deployment of social media icons. Source: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-social-icons

```bash
npm install react-social-icons
```
